Photons are idealquantum systems because they operate at room temperature, and photonictechnologies are relatively mature. The field is largely divided betweendiscrete- and continuous-variable photonic quantum computation. Indiscrete-variable (DV) photonic quantum computation, quantum information isrepresented by one or more modal properties (e.g. polarization) that take ondistinct values from a finite set. Quantum information is processed viaoperations on these modal properties and eventually measured using singlephoton detectors. In continuous-variable (CV) photonic quantum computation,quantum information is represented by properties of the electromagnetic fieldthat take on any value in an interval (e.g. position). The electromagneticfield is transformed via Gaussian and non-Gaussian operations, and thendetected via homodyne detection. Both CV and DV photonic quantum computationhave been realized experimentally and they each have a unique set of challengesthat need to be overcome to achieve scalable photonic universal quantumcomputation.

It is shown that unconventional quantum computing devices can in prin-\\n                 ciple compute some quantities more rapidly than ‚Äòconventional‚Äô quantum computers.\\n\\n                      Computers are physical: what they can and cannot do is determined by the laws\\n                 of physics. When scientific progress augments or revises those laws, our picture of what\\n                 computers can do changes. Currently, quantum mechanics is generally accepted as the\\n                 fundamental dynamical theory of how physical systems behave. Quantum computers can\\n                 in principle exploit quantum coherence to perform computational tasks that classical com-\\n                 puters cannot [1-21]. If someday quantum mechanics should turn out to be incomplete\\n                 or faulty, then our picture of what computers can do will change. In addition, the set\\n                 of known quantum phenomena is constantly increasing: essentially any coherent quantum\\n                 phenomenon involving nonlinear interactions between quantum degrees of freedom can\\n                 in principle be exploited to perform quantum logic. This paper discusses how the revi-\\n                 sion of fundamental laws and the discovery of new quantum phenomena can lead to new\\n                 technologies and algorithms for quantum computers.\\n                      Since new quantum effects are discovered seemingly every day, let‚Äôs first discuss two\\n                 basic tests that a phenomenon must pass to be able to function as a basis for quantum\\n                 computation. These are 1) The phenomenon must be nonlinear, and 2) It must be coherent.\\n                 To support quantum logic, the phenomenon must involve some form of nonlinearity, e.g.,\\n                 a nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom. Without such a nonlinearity\\n                 quantum devices, like linear classical devices, cannot perform even so simple a nonlinear\\n                 operation as an AND gate. Quantum coherence is a prerequisite for performing tasks\\n                 such as factoring using Shor‚Äôs algorithm [10], quantum simulation a la Feynman [11] and\\n                 Lloyd [12], or Grover‚Äôs data-base search algorithm [13], all of which require extended\\n                 manipulations of coherent quantum superpositions.\\n\\n                                                                        1', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '1c68371a-5288-45c3-bca7-c73f5a3ada20', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': '      The requirements of nonlinearity and coherence are not only necessary for a phe-\\nnomenon to support quantum computation, they are also in principle sufficient. As shown\\nin [14-15], essentially any nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom suf-\\nfices to construct universal quantum logic gates that can be assembled into a quantum\\ncomputer. In addition, the work of Preskill et al. [18] on robust quantum computation\\nshows that an error rate of no more than 10‚àí4 per quantum logic operation allows one to\\nperform arbitrarily long quantum computations in principle.\\n      In practice, of course, few if any quantum phenomena are likely to prove sufficiently\\ncontrollable to provide extended quantum computation. Promising devices under current\\nexperimental investigation include ion traps [5,7], high finesse cavities for manipulating\\nlight and atoms using quantum electrodynamics [6], and molecular systems that can be\\nmade to compute using nuclear magnetic resonance [8-9]. Such devices store quantum\\ninformation on the states of quantum systems such as photons, atoms, or nuclei, and\\naccomplish quantum logic by manipulating the interactions between the systems via the\\napplication of semiclassical potentials such as microwave or laser fields. We will call such\\ndevices ‚Äòconventional‚Äô quantum computers, if only because such devices have actually been\\nconstructed.\\n      There is another sense in which such computers are conventional: although the de-\\nvices described above have already been used to explore new regimes in physics and to\\ncreate and investigate the properties of new and exotic quantum states of matter, they\\nfunction according to well established and well understood laws of physics. Perhaps the\\nmost striking examples of the ‚Äòconventionality‚Äô of current quantum logic devices are NMR\\nquantum microprocessors that are operated using techniques that have been refined for\\nalmost half a century. Ion-trap and quantum electrodynamic quantum computers, though\\ncertainly cutting edge devices, operate in a quantum electrodynamic regime where the\\nfundamental physics has been understood for decades (that is not to say that new and\\nunexpected physics does not arise frequently in this regime, rather that there is general\\nagreement on how to model the dynamics of such devices).\\n      Make no mistake about it: a conventional quantum logic device is the best kind of\\nquantum logic device to have around. It is exactly because the physics of nuclear magnetic\\nresonance and quantum electrodynamics are well understood that devices based on this\\nphysics can be used systematically to construct and manipulate the exotic quantum states\\nthat form the basis for quantum computation. With that recognition, let us turn to\\n\\n                                                         2', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'daa6c725-e997-411a-87c9-163d9c3acee2', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': '‚Äòunconventional‚Äô quantum computers.\\n      Perhaps the most obvious basis for an unconventional quantum computer is the use\\nof particles with non-Boltzmann statistics in a refime where these statistics play a key role\\nin the dynamics of the device. For example, Lloyd [16] has proposed the use of fermions\\nas the fundamental carriers of quantum information, so that a site or state occupied by a\\nfermion represents a 1 and an unoccupied site or state represents a 0. It is straightforward\\nto design a universal quantum computer using a conditional hopping dynamics on an array\\nof sites, in which a fermion hops from one site to another if only if other sites are occupied.\\n      If the array is one-dimensional, then such a fermionic quantum computer is equivalent\\nto a conventional quantum computer via the well-known technique of bosonization. If the\\narray is two or more dimensional, however, a local operation involving fermions on the\\nlattice cannot be mocked up by a local operation on a conventional quantum computer,\\nwhich must explicitly keep track of the phases induced by Fermi statistics. As a result,\\nsuch a fermionic computer can perform certain operations more rapidly than a conventional\\nquantum computer. An obvious example of a problem that can be solved more rapidly on\\na fermionic quantum computer is the problem of simulating a lattice fermionic system in\\ntwo or more dimensions. To get the antisymmetrization right in second quantized form,\\na conventional ‚ÄòBoltzmann‚Äô quantum computer takes time proportional to T ‚Ñìd‚àí1 where T\\nis the time over which the simulation is to take place, ‚Ñì is the length of the lattice and\\nd is the dimension, while a fermionic quantum computer takes time proportional to T .\\n(Here we assume that the computations for both conventional and Fermionic quantum\\ncomputers can take advantage of the intrinsic parallelizability of such simulations: if the\\ncomputations are performed serially an additional factro of ‚Ñìd is required for both types\\nof computer to update each site sequentially.)\\n      As the lattice size ‚Ñì and the dimension d grow large, the difference between the two\\ntypes of computer also grows large. Indeed, the problem of simulating fermions hopping\\non a hypercube of dimension d as d ‚Üí ‚àû is evidently exponentially harder on a con-\\nventional quantum computer than a Fermionic quantum computer. Since a variety of\\ndifficult problems such as the travelling-salesman problem and data-base search problem\\ncan be mapped to particles hopping on a hypercube, it is interesting to speculate whether\\nfermionic computers might provide an exponential speed-up on problems of interest in ad-\\ndition to quantum simulation. No such problems are currently known, however. Fermionic\\ncomputers could be realized in principle by manipulating the ways in which electrons and\\n\\n                                                          3', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '5c333a8a-404b-4066-9023-5603f070a9fd', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'holes hop from site to site on a semiconductor lattice (though problems of decoherence are\\nlikely to be relatively severe for such systems).\\n      It might also be possible to construct bosonic computers using photons, phonons, or\\natoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Such systems can be highly coherent and support\\nnonlinear interactions: phonons and photons can interact in a nonlinear fshion via their\\ncommon nonlinear interaction with matter, and atoms in a Bose condensate can be made\\nto interact bia quantum electrodynamics (by introduction of a cavity) or by collisions. So\\nfar, however, the feature of Bose condensates that makes them so interesting from the point\\nof view of physics ‚Äî all particles in the same state ‚Äî makes them less interesting from the\\npoint of view of quantum computation. Many particles in the same state, which can be\\nmanipulated coherently by a variety of techniques, explore the same volume of Hilbert space\\nas a single particle in that state. As a result, it is unclear how such a bosonic system could\\nprovide a speed-up over conventional quantum computation. More promising than Bose\\ncondensates from the perspective of quantum computation and quantum communications,\\nis the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to ‚Äòdial up‚Äô or synthesize arbitrary states\\nof the cavity field. Such a use of bosonic states is important for the field of quantum\\ncommunications, which requires the ability to create and manipulate entangled states of\\nthe electromagnetic field.\\n      A third unconventional design for a quantum computer relies on ‚Äòexotic‚Äô statistics\\nthat are neither fermionic nor bosonic. Kitaev has recently proposed a quantum computer\\narchitecture based on ‚Äòanyons,‚Äô particles that when exchanged acquuire an arbitrary phase.\\nExamples of anyons include two-dimensional topological defects in lattice systems of spins\\nwith various symmetries. Kitaev noted that such anyons could perform quantum logic via\\nAharonov-Bohm type interactions [19]. Preskill et al. have shown explicitly how anyonic\\nsystems could compute in principle [20], and Lloyd et al. have proposed methods of\\nrealizing anyons using superconducting circuits (they could also in principle be constructed\\nusing NMR quantum computers to mock up the anyonic dynamics in an effectively two-\\ndimensional space of spins) [21]. The advantage of using anyons for quantum computation\\nis that their nonlocal topological nature can make them intrinsically error-correcting and\\nvirtually immune to the effects of noise and interference.\\n      As the technologies of the microscale become better developed, more and more po-\\ntential designs for quantum computers, both conventional and unconventional, are likely\\nto arise. Additional technologies that could prove useful for the construction of quantum\\n\\n                                                          4', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'cd814aea-fa06-44c7-84eb-5d76c94eedf4', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': ' logic devices include photonic crystals, optical hole-burning techniques, electron spin res-\\n onance, quantum dots, superconducting circuits in the quantum regime, etc. Since every\\n quantum degree of freedom can in principle participate in a computation one cannot a\\n priori rule out the possibility of using currently hard to control degrees of freedom such as\\nquark and gluon in complex nuclei to process information. Needless to say, most if not all\\nof the designs inspired by these technologies are likely to fail. There is room for optimism\\nthat some such quantum computer designs will prove practicable, however.\\n      The preceding unconventional designs for quantum computers were based on existing,\\nexperimentally confirmed physical phenomena (except in the case of non-abelian anyons).\\nLet us now turn to designs based on speculative, hypothetical, and not yet verified phenom-\\nena. (One of the most interesting of these phenomena is large-scale quantum computation\\nitself: can we create and systematically transform entangled states involving hundreds or\\nthousands of quantum variables?) A particularly powerful hypothesis from the point of\\nview of quantum computation is that of nonlinear quantum mechanics.\\n      The conventional picture of quantum mechanics is that it is linear in the sense that the\\nsuperposition principle is obeyed exactly. (Of course, quantum systems can still exhibit\\nnonlinear interactions between degrees of freedom while continuing to obey the superpo-\\nsition principle.) Experiment confirms that the superposition principle is indeed obeyed\\nto a high degree of accuracy. Nonetheless, a number of scientists including Weinberg have\\nproposed nonlinear versions of quantum mechanics in which the superposition principle\\nis violated. Many of these proposals exhibit pathologies such as violations of the second\\nlaw of thermodynamics or the capacity for superluminal communication. Despite such\\ntheoretical difficulties, it is still possible that quantum mechanics does indeed possess a\\nsmall nonlinearity, even if it currently seems unlikely. If a nonlinear operation such as\\nthat proposed by Weinberg can be incorporated in a quantum logic operation, then the\\nconsequences are striking: NP-complete problems can be solved easily in polynomial time\\n[17]. Indeed, NP-oracle problems and all problems in #P can be solved in polynomial time\\non such a nonlinear quantum computer.\\n      A general proof of this result is given in [17], however, a simple argument for why\\nthis is so can be seen as follows. Suppose that it is possible to perform a non-unitary\\noperation on a single qubit that has a positive Lyapunov exponent over some region: i.e.,\\nsomewhere on the unit sphere there exists a line of finite extent along which application of\\nthe operation causes nearby points to move apart exponentially at a rate eŒª‚àÜŒ∏ proportional\\n                                                           5', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '5088dfa3-2556-47a0-bef7-d779e4baf772', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'to their original angular separation Œ¥Œ∏. Now consider a function f (x) from N bits to one\\nbit. We wish to determine whether or not there exists an x such that f (x) = 1, and if\\nso, how many such x‚Äôs there are. Using the nonlinear operation with positive Lyapunov\\nexponent, it is straightforward to construct a mapping leaves a point on the exponentially\\nexpanding line (call this point |0„Äâ) fixed if their are no solutions to the equation f (x) = 1,\\nand that maps the point to a nearby point cos(n/2N )|0„Äâ + sin(n/2N )|1„Äâ along the line\\nif there are exactly n solutions to the equation f (x) = 1. Repeated application of the\\nnonlinear map can be used to drive the points apart at an exponentional rate: eventually,\\nat a time determined by the number of qubits N , the number of solutions n, and the rate\\nof spreading Œª, the two points will become macroscopically distinguishable, allowing one\\nto determine whether or not there is a solution and if there is, how many solutions there\\nare. The map f need only be applied once, and the amount of time it takes to reveal the\\nnumber of solutions is proportional to N .\\n      The fact that nonlinear quantum mechanics allows the straightforward solution of\\nNP-complete and #P problems should probably be regarded as yet another strike against\\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. Whether or not quantum mechanics is linear is a question\\nto be resolved experimentally, however. In the unlikely event that quantum mechanics\\ndoes turn out to be nonlinear, all our problems may be solved.\\n      Finally, let us turn our attention to hypothetical quantum Theories of Everything,\\nsuch as string theory. Such a theory must clearly support quantum computation since it\\nsupports cavity quantum electrodynamics and nuclear magnetic resonance. The obvious\\nquestion to ask is then, does a Theory of Everything need to support anything more than\\nquantum computation? So far as experimental evidence is concerned the answer to this\\nquestion is apparently No: we have no evident reason to doubt that the universe is at\\nbottom anything more than a giant, parallel, quantum information processing machine,\\nand that the phenomena that we observe and attempt to characterize are simply outputs\\nof this machine‚Äôs ongoing computation. Of course, just how the universe is carrying out\\nthis computation is likely to remain a question of great interest for some time.\\n      To summarize: Computers are physical systems, and what they can do in practice and\\nin principle is circumscribed by the laws of physics.

It is shown that unconventional quantum computing devices can in prin-\\n                 ciple compute some quantities more rapidly than ‚Äòconventional‚Äô quantum computers.\\n\\n                      Computers are physical: what they can and cannot do is determined by the laws\\n                 of physics. When scientific progress augments or revises those laws, our picture of what\\n                 computers can do changes. Currently, quantum mechanics is generally accepted as the\\n                 fundamental dynamical theory of how physical systems behave. Quantum computers can\\n                 in principle exploit quantum coherence to perform computational tasks that classical com-\\n                 puters cannot [1-21]. If someday quantum mechanics should turn out to be incomplete\\n                 or faulty, then our picture of what computers can do will change. In addition, the set\\n                 of known quantum phenomena is constantly increasing: essentially any coherent quantum\\n                 phenomenon involving nonlinear interactions between quantum degrees of freedom can\\n                 in principle be exploited to perform quantum logic. This paper discusses how the revi-\\n                 sion of fundamental laws and the discovery of new quantum phenomena can lead to new\\n                 technologies and algorithms for quantum computers.\\n                      Since new quantum effects are discovered seemingly every day, let‚Äôs first discuss two\\n                 basic tests that a phenomenon must pass to be able to function as a basis for quantum\\n                 computation. These are 1) The phenomenon must be nonlinear, and 2) It must be coherent.\\n                 To support quantum logic, the phenomenon must involve some form of nonlinearity, e.g.,\\n                 a nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom. Without such a nonlinearity\\n                 quantum devices, like linear classical devices, cannot perform even so simple a nonlinear\\n                 operation as an AND gate. Quantum coherence is a prerequisite for performing tasks\\n                 such as factoring using Shor‚Äôs algorithm [10], quantum simulation a la Feynman [11] and\\n                 Lloyd [12], or Grover‚Äôs data-base search algorithm [13], all of which require extended\\n                 manipulations of coherent quantum superpositions.\\n\\n                                                                        1', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '1c68371a-5288-45c3-bca7-c73f5a3ada20', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': '      The requirements of nonlinearity and coherence are not only necessary for a phe-\\nnomenon to support quantum computation, they are also in principle sufficient. As shown\\nin [14-15], essentially any nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom suf-\\nfices to construct universal quantum logic gates that can be assembled into a quantum\\ncomputer.

[18] on robust quantum computation\\nshows that an error rate of no more than 10‚àí4 per quantum logic operation allows one to\\nperform arbitrarily long quantum computations in principle.\\n      In practice, of course, few if any quantum phenomena are likely to prove sufficiently\\ncontrollable to provide extended quantum computation. Promising devices under current\\nexperimental investigation include ion traps [5,7], high finesse cavities for manipulating\\nlight and atoms using quantum electrodynamics [6], and molecular systems that can be\\nmade to compute using nuclear magnetic resonance [8-9]. Such devices store quantum\\ninformation on the states of quantum systems such as photons, atoms, or nuclei, and\\naccomplish quantum logic by manipulating the interactions between the systems via the\\napplication of semiclassical potentials such as microwave or laser fields. We will call such\\ndevices ‚Äòconventional‚Äô quantum computers, if only because such devices have actually been\\nconstructed.\\n      There is another sense in which such computers are conventional: although the de-\\nvices described above have already been used to explore new regimes in physics and to\\ncreate and investigate the properties of new and exotic quantum states of matter, they\\nfunction according to well established and well understood laws of physics. Perhaps the\\nmost striking examples of the ‚Äòconventionality‚Äô of current quantum logic devices are NMR\\nquantum microprocessors that are operated using techniques that have been refined for\\nalmost half a century. Ion-trap and quantum electrodynamic quantum computers, though\\ncertainly cutting edge devices, operate in a quantum electrodynamic regime where the\\nfundamental physics has been understood for decades (that is not to say that new and\\nunexpected physics does not arise frequently in this regime, rather that there is general\\nagreement on how to model the dynamics of such devices).\\n      Make no mistake about it: a conventional quantum logic device is the best kind of\\nquantum logic device to have around. It is exactly because the physics of nuclear magnetic\\nresonance and quantum electrodynamics are well understood that devices based on this\\nphysics can be used systematically to construct and manipulate the exotic quantum states\\nthat form the basis for quantum computation. With that recognition, let us turn to\\n\\n                                                         2', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'daa6c725-e997-411a-87c9-163d9c3acee2', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': '‚Äòunconventional‚Äô quantum computers.\\n      Perhaps the most obvious basis for an unconventional quantum computer is the use\\nof particles with non-Boltzmann statistics in a refime where these statistics play a key role\\nin the dynamics of the device. For example, Lloyd [16] has proposed the use of fermions\\nas the fundamental carriers of quantum information, so that a site or state occupied by a\\nfermion represents a 1 and an unoccupied site or state represents a 0. It is straightforward\\nto design a universal quantum computer using a conditional hopping dynamics on an array\\nof sites, in which a fermion hops from one site to another if only if other sites are occupied.\\n      If the array is one-dimensional, then such a fermionic quantum computer is equivalent\\nto a conventional quantum computer via the well-known technique of bosonization. If the\\narray is two or more dimensional, however, a local operation involving fermions on the\\nlattice cannot be mocked up by a local operation on a conventional quantum computer,\\nwhich must explicitly keep track of the phases induced by Fermi statistics. As a result,\\nsuch a fermionic computer can perform certain operations more rapidly than a conventional\\nquantum computer. An obvious example of a problem that can be solved more rapidly on\\na fermionic quantum computer is the problem of simulating a lattice fermionic system in\\ntwo or more dimensions. To get the antisymmetrization right in second quantized form,\\na conventional ‚ÄòBoltzmann‚Äô quantum computer takes time proportional to T ‚Ñìd‚àí1 where T\\nis the time over which the simulation is to take place, ‚Ñì is the length of the lattice and\\nd is the dimension, while a fermionic quantum computer takes time proportional to T .\\n(Here we assume that the computations for both conventional and Fermionic quantum\\ncomputers can take advantage of the intrinsic parallelizability of such simulations: if the\\ncomputations are performed serially an additional factro of ‚Ñìd is required for both types\\nof computer to update each site sequentially.)\\n      As the lattice size ‚Ñì and the dimension d grow large, the difference between the two\\ntypes of computer also grows large. Indeed, the problem of simulating fermions hopping\\non a hypercube of dimension d as d ‚Üí ‚àû is evidently exponentially harder on a con-\\nventional quantum computer than a Fermionic quantum computer. Since a variety of\\ndifficult problems such as the travelling-salesman problem and data-base search problem\\ncan be mapped to particles hopping on a hypercube, it is interesting to speculate whether\\nfermionic computers might provide an exponential speed-up on problems of interest in ad-\\ndition to quantum simulation. No such problems are currently known, however. Fermionic\\ncomputers could be realized in principle by manipulating the ways in which electrons and\\n\\n                                                          3', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '5c333a8a-404b-4066-9023-5603f070a9fd', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'holes hop from site to site on a semiconductor lattice (though problems of decoherence are\\nlikely to be relatively severe for such systems).\\n      It might also be possible to construct bosonic computers using photons, phonons, or\\natoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Such systems can be highly coherent and support\\nnonlinear interactions: phonons and photons can interact in a nonlinear fshion via their\\ncommon nonlinear interaction with matter, and atoms in a Bose condensate can be made\\nto interact bia quantum electrodynamics (by introduction of a cavity) or by collisions. So\\nfar, however, the feature of Bose condensates that makes them so interesting from the point\\nof view of physics ‚Äî all particles in the same state ‚Äî makes them less interesting from the\\npoint of view of quantum computation. Many particles in the same state, which can be\\nmanipulated coherently by a variety of techniques, explore the same volume of Hilbert space\\nas a single particle in that state. As a result, it is unclear how such a bosonic system could\\nprovide a speed-up over conventional quantum computation. More promising than Bose\\ncondensates from the perspective of quantum computation and quantum communications,\\nis the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to ‚Äòdial up‚Äô or synthesize arbitrary states\\nof the cavity field. Such a use of bosonic states is important for the field of quantum\\ncommunications, which requires the ability to create and manipulate entangled states of\\nthe electromagnetic field.\\n      A third unconventional design for a quantum computer relies on ‚Äòexotic‚Äô statistics\\nthat are neither fermionic nor bosonic. Kitaev has recently proposed a quantum computer\\narchitecture based on ‚Äòanyons,‚Äô particles that when exchanged acquuire an arbitrary phase.\\nExamples of anyons include two-dimensional topological defects in lattice systems of spins\\nwith various symmetries. Kitaev noted that such anyons could perform quantum logic via\\nAharonov-Bohm type interactions [19]. Preskill et al. have shown explicitly how anyonic\\nsystems could compute in principle [20], and Lloyd et al. have proposed methods of\\nrealizing anyons using superconducting circuits (they could also in principle be constructed\\nusing NMR quantum computers to mock up the anyonic dynamics in an effectively two-\\ndimensional space of spins) [21]. The advantage of using anyons for quantum computation\\nis that their nonlocal topological nature can make them intrinsically error-correcting and\\nvirtually immune to the effects of noise and interference.\\n      As the technologies of the microscale become better developed, more and more po-\\ntential designs for quantum computers, both conventional and unconventional, are likely\\nto arise. Additional technologies that could prove useful for the construction of quantum\\n\\n                                                          4', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'cd814aea-fa06-44c7-84eb-5d76c94eedf4', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': ' logic devices include photonic crystals, optical hole-burning techniques, electron spin res-\\n onance, quantum dots, superconducting circuits in the quantum regime, etc. Since every\\n quantum degree of freedom can in principle participate in a computation one cannot a\\n priori rule out the possibility of using currently hard to control degrees of freedom such as\\nquark and gluon in complex nuclei to process information. Needless to say, most if not all\\nof the designs inspired by these technologies are likely to fail. There is room for optimism\\nthat some such quantum computer designs will prove practicable, however.\\n      The preceding unconventional designs for quantum computers were based on existing,\\nexperimentally confirmed physical phenomena (except in the case of non-abelian anyons).\\nLet us now turn to designs based on speculative, hypothetical, and not yet verified phenom-\\nena. (One of the most interesting of these phenomena is large-scale quantum computation\\nitself: can we create and systematically transform entangled states involving hundreds or\\nthousands of quantum variables?) A particularly powerful hypothesis from the point of\\nview of quantum computation is that of nonlinear quantum mechanics.\\n      The conventional picture of quantum mechanics is that it is linear in the sense that the\\nsuperposition principle is obeyed exactly. (Of course, quantum systems can still exhibit\\nnonlinear interactions between degrees of freedom while continuing to obey the superpo-\\nsition principle.) Experiment confirms that the superposition principle is indeed obeyed\\nto a high degree of accuracy. Nonetheless, a number of scientists including Weinberg have\\nproposed nonlinear versions of quantum mechanics in which the superposition principle\\nis violated. Many of these proposals exhibit pathologies such as violations of the second\\nlaw of thermodynamics or the capacity for superluminal communication. Despite such\\ntheoretical difficulties, it is still possible that quantum mechanics does indeed possess a\\nsmall nonlinearity, even if it currently seems unlikely. If a nonlinear operation such as\\nthat proposed by Weinberg can be incorporated in a quantum logic operation, then the\\nconsequences are striking: NP-complete problems can be solved easily in polynomial time\\n[17]. Indeed, NP-oracle problems and all problems in #P can be solved in polynomial time\\non such a nonlinear quantum computer.\\n      A general proof of this result is given in [17], however, a simple argument for why\\nthis is so can be seen as follows. Suppose that it is possible to perform a non-unitary\\noperation on a single qubit that has a positive Lyapunov exponent over some region: i.e.,\\nsomewhere on the unit sphere there exists a line of finite extent along which application of\\nthe operation causes nearby points to move apart exponentially at a rate eŒª‚àÜŒ∏ proportional\\n                                                           5', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '5088dfa3-2556-47a0-bef7-d779e4baf772', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'to their original angular separation Œ¥Œ∏. Now consider a function f (x) from N bits to one\\nbit. We wish to determine whether or not there exists an x such that f (x) = 1, and if\\nso, how many such x‚Äôs there are. Using the nonlinear operation with positive Lyapunov\\nexponent, it is straightforward to construct a mapping leaves a point on the exponentially\\nexpanding line (call this point |0„Äâ) fixed if their are no solutions to the equation f (x) = 1,\\nand that maps the point to a nearby point cos(n/2N )|0„Äâ + sin(n/2N )|1„Äâ along the line\\nif there are exactly n solutions to the equation f (x) = 1. Repeated application of the\\nnonlinear map can be used to drive the points apart at an exponentional rate: eventually,\\nat a time determined by the number of qubits N , the number of solutions n, and the rate\\nof spreading Œª, the two points will become macroscopically distinguishable, allowing one\\nto determine whether or not there is a solution and if there is, how many solutions there\\nare. The map f need only be applied once, and the amount of time it takes to reveal the\\nnumber of solutions is proportional to N .\\n      The fact that nonlinear quantum mechanics allows the straightforward solution of\\nNP-complete and #P problems should probably be regarded as yet another strike against\\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. Whether or not quantum mechanics is linear is a question\\nto be resolved experimentally, however. In the unlikely event that quantum mechanics\\ndoes turn out to be nonlinear, all our problems may be solved.\\n      Finally, let us turn our attention to hypothetical quantum Theories of Everything,\\nsuch as string theory. Such a theory must clearly support quantum computation since it\\nsupports cavity quantum electrodynamics and nuclear magnetic resonance. The obvious\\nquestion to ask is then, does a Theory of Everything need to support anything more than\\nquantum computation? So far as experimental evidence is concerned the answer to this\\nquestion is apparently No: we have no evident reason to doubt that the universe is at\\nbottom anything more than a giant, parallel, quantum information processing machine,\\nand that the phenomena that we observe and attempt to characterize are simply outputs\\nof this machine‚Äôs ongoing computation. Of course, just how the universe is carrying out\\nthis computation is likely to remain a question of great interest for some time.\\n      To summarize: Computers are physical systems, and what they can do in practice and\\nin principle is circumscribed by the laws of physics. The laws of physics in turn permit a\\nwide variety of quantum computational devices including some based on nonconventional\\nstatistics and exotic effects. Modifications made to the laws of physics have the consequence\\nthat what can be computed in practice and in principle changes.

It is shown that unconventional quantum computing devices can in prin-\\\\n                 ciple compute some quantities more rapidly than ‚Äòconventional‚Äô quantum computers.\\\\n\\\\n                      Computers are physical: what they can and cannot do is determined by the laws\\\\n                 of physics. When scientific progress augments or revises those laws, our picture of what\\\\n                 computers can do changes. Currently, quantum mechanics is generally accepted as the\\\\n                 fundamental dynamical theory of how physical systems behave. Quantum computers can\\\\n                 in principle exploit quantum coherence to perform computational tasks that classical com-\\\\n                 puters cannot [1-21]. If someday quantum mechanics should turn out to be incomplete\\\\n                 or faulty, then our picture of what computers can do will change. In addition, the set\\\\n                 of known quantum phenomena is constantly increasing: essentially any coherent quantum\\\\n                 phenomenon involving nonlinear interactions between quantum degrees of freedom can\\\\n                 in principle be exploited to perform quantum logic. This paper discusses how the revi-\\\\n                 sion of fundamental laws and the discovery of new quantum phenomena can lead to new\\\\n                 technologies and algorithms for quantum computers.\\\\n                      Since new quantum effects are discovered seemingly every day, let‚Äôs first discuss two\\\\n                 basic tests that a phenomenon must pass to be able to function as a basis for quantum\\\\n                 computation. These are 1) The phenomenon must be nonlinear, and 2) It must be coherent.\\\\n                 To support quantum logic, the phenomenon must involve some form of nonlinearity, e.g.,\\\\n                 a nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom. Without such a nonlinearity\\\\n                 quantum devices, like linear classical devices, cannot perform even so simple a nonlinear\\\\n                 operation as an AND gate. Quantum coherence is a prerequisite for performing tasks\\\\n                 such as factoring using Shor‚Äôs algorithm [10], quantum simulation a la Feynman [11] and\\\\n                 Lloyd [12], or Grover‚Äôs data-base search algorithm [13], all of which require extended\\\\n                 manipulations of coherent quantum superpositions.\\\\n\\\\n                                                                        1', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '1c68371a-5288-45c3-bca7-c73f5a3ada20', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': '      The requirements of nonlinearity and coherence are not only necessary for a phe-\\\\nnomenon to support quantum computation, they are also in principle sufficient. As shown\\\\nin [14-15], essentially any nonlinear interaction between quantum degrees of freedom suf-\\\\nfices to construct universal quantum logic gates that can be assembled into a quantum\\\\ncomputer. In addition, the work of Preskill et al. [18] on robust quantum computation\\\\nshows that an error rate of no more than 10‚àí4 per quantum logic operation allows one to\\\\nperform arbitrarily long quantum computations in principle.\\\\n      In practice, of course, few if any quantum phenomena are likely to prove sufficiently\\\\ncontrollable to provide extended quantum computation. Promising devices under current\\\\nexperimental investigation include ion traps [5,7], high finesse cavities for manipulating\\\\nlight and atoms using quantum electrodynamics [6], and molecular systems that can be\\\\nmade to compute using nuclear magnetic resonance [8-9]. Such devices store quantum\\\\ninformation on the states of quantum systems such as photons, atoms, or nuclei, and\\\\naccomplish quantum logic by manipulating the interactions between the systems via the\\\\napplication of semiclassical potentials such as microwave or laser fields. We will call such\\\\ndevices ‚Äòconventional‚Äô quantum computers, if only because such devices have actually been\\\\nconstructed.\\\\n      There is another sense in which such computers are conventional: although the de-\\\\nvices described above have already been used to explore new regimes in physics and to\\\\ncreate and investigate the properties of new and exotic quantum states of matter, they\\\\nfunction according to well established and well understood laws of physics. Perhaps the\\\\nmost striking examples of the ‚Äòconventionality‚Äô of current quantum logic devices are NMR\\\\nquantum microprocessors that are operated using techniques that have been refined for\\\\nalmost half a century. Ion-trap and quantum electrodynamic quantum computers, though\\\\ncertainly cutting edge devices, operate in a quantum electrodynamic regime where the\\\\nfundamental physics has been understood for decades (that is not to say that new and\\\\nunexpected physics does not arise frequently in this regime, rather that there is general\\\\nagreement on how to model the dynamics of such devices).\\\\n      Make no mistake about it: a conventional quantum logic device is the best kind of\\\\nquantum logic device to have around. It is exactly because the physics of nuclear magnetic\\\\nresonance and quantum electrodynamics are well understood that devices based on this\\\\nphysics can be used systematically to construct and manipulate the exotic quantum states\\\\nthat form the basis for quantum computation. With that recognition, let us turn to\\\\n\\\\n                                                         2', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'daa6c725-e997-411a-87c9-163d9c3acee2', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': '‚Äòunconventional‚Äô quantum computers.\\\\n      Perhaps the most obvious basis for an unconventional quantum computer is the use\\\\nof particles with non-Boltzmann statistics in a refime where these statistics play a key role\\\\nin the dynamics of the device. For example, Lloyd [16] has proposed the use of fermions\\\\nas the fundamental carriers of quantum information, so that a site or state occupied by a\\\\nfermion represents a 1 and an unoccupied site or state represents a 0. It is straightforward\\\\nto design a universal quantum computer using a conditional hopping dynamics on an array\\\\nof sites, in which a fermion hops from one site to another if only if other sites are occupied.\\\\n      If the array is one-dimensional, then such a fermionic quantum computer is equivalent\\\\nto a conventional quantum computer via the well-known technique of bosonization. If the\\\\narray is two or more dimensional, however, a local operation involving fermions on the\\\\nlattice cannot be mocked up by a local operation on a conventional quantum computer,\\\\nwhich must explicitly keep track of the phases induced by Fermi statistics. As a result,\\\\nsuch a fermionic computer can perform certain operations more rapidly than a conventional\\\\nquantum computer. An obvious example of a problem that can be solved more rapidly on\\\\na fermionic quantum computer is the problem of simulating a lattice fermionic system in\\\\ntwo or more dimensions. To get the antisymmetrization right in second quantized form,\\\\na conventional ‚ÄòBoltzmann‚Äô quantum computer takes time proportional to T ‚Ñìd‚àí1 where T\\\\nis the time over which the simulation is to take place, ‚Ñì is the length of the lattice and\\\\nd is the dimension, while a fermionic quantum computer takes time proportional to T .\\\\n(Here we assume that the computations for both conventional and Fermionic quantum\\\\ncomputers can take advantage of the intrinsic parallelizability of such simulations: if the\\\\ncomputations are performed serially an additional factro of ‚Ñìd is required for both types\\\\nof computer to update each site sequentially.)\\\\n      As the lattice size ‚Ñì and the dimension d grow large, the difference between the two\\\\ntypes of computer also grows large. Indeed, the problem of simulating fermions hopping\\\\non a hypercube of dimension d as d ‚Üí ‚àû is evidently exponentially harder on a con-\\\\nventional quantum computer than a Fermionic quantum computer. Since a variety of\\\\ndifficult problems such as the travelling-salesman problem and data-base search problem\\\\ncan be mapped to particles hopping on a hypercube, it is interesting to speculate whether\\\\nfermionic computers might provide an exponential speed-up on problems of interest in ad-\\\\ndition to quantum simulation. No such problems are currently known, however. Fermionic\\\\ncomputers could be realized in principle by manipulating the ways in which electrons and\\\\n\\\\n                                                          3', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '5c333a8a-404b-4066-9023-5603f070a9fd', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'holes hop from site to site on a semiconductor lattice (though problems of decoherence are\\\\nlikely to be relatively severe for such systems).\\\\n      It might also be possible to construct bosonic computers using photons, phonons, or\\\\natoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. Such systems can be highly coherent and support\\\\nnonlinear interactions: phonons and photons can interact in a nonlinear fshion via their\\\\ncommon nonlinear interaction with matter, and atoms in a Bose condensate can be made\\\\nto interact bia quantum electrodynamics (by introduction of a cavity) or by collisions. So\\\\nfar, however, the feature of Bose condensates that makes them so interesting from the point\\\\nof view of physics ‚Äî all particles in the same state ‚Äî makes them less interesting from the\\\\npoint of view of quantum computation. Many particles in the same state, which can be\\\\nmanipulated coherently by a variety of techniques, explore the same volume of Hilbert space\\\\nas a single particle in that state. As a result, it is unclear how such a bosonic system could\\\\nprovide a speed-up over conventional quantum computation. More promising than Bose\\\\ncondensates from the perspective of quantum computation and quantum communications,\\\\nis the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to ‚Äòdial up‚Äô or synthesize arbitrary states\\\\nof the cavity field. Such a use of bosonic states is important for the field of quantum\\\\ncommunications, which requires the ability to create and manipulate entangled states of\\\\nthe electromagnetic field.\\\\n      A third unconventional design for a quantum computer relies on ‚Äòexotic‚Äô statistics\\\\nthat are neither fermionic nor bosonic. Kitaev has recently proposed a quantum computer\\\\narchitecture based on ‚Äòanyons,‚Äô particles that when exchanged acquuire an arbitrary phase.\\\\nExamples of anyons include two-dimensional topological defects in lattice systems of spins\\\\nwith various symmetries. Kitaev noted that such anyons could perform quantum logic via\\\\nAharonov-Bohm type interactions [19]. Preskill et al. have shown explicitly how anyonic\\\\nsystems could compute in principle [20], and Lloyd et al. have proposed methods of\\\\nrealizing anyons using superconducting circuits (they could also in principle be constructed\\\\nusing NMR quantum computers to mock up the anyonic dynamics in an effectively two-\\\\ndimensional space of spins) [21]. The advantage of using anyons for quantum computation\\\\nis that their nonlocal topological nature can make them intrinsically error-correcting and\\\\nvirtually immune to the effects of noise and interference.\\\\n      As the technologies of the microscale become better developed, more and more po-\\\\ntential designs for quantum computers, both conventional and unconventional, are likely\\\\nto arise. Additional technologies that could prove useful for the construction of quantum\\\\n\\\\n                                                          4', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': 'cd814aea-fa06-44c7-84eb-5d76c94eedf4', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': ' logic devices include photonic crystals, optical hole-burning techniques, electron spin res-\\\\n onance, quantum dots, superconducting circuits in the quantum regime, etc. Since every\\\\n quantum degree of freedom can in principle participate in a computation one cannot a\\\\n priori rule out the possibility of using currently hard to control degrees of freedom such as\\\\nquark and gluon in complex nuclei to process information. Needless to say, most if not all\\\\nof the designs inspired by these technologies are likely to fail. There is room for optimism\\\\nthat some such quantum computer designs will prove practicable, however.\\\\n      The preceding unconventional designs for quantum computers were based on existing,\\\\nexperimentally confirmed physical phenomena (except in the case of non-abelian anyons).\\\\nLet us now turn to designs based on speculative, hypothetical, and not yet verified phenom-\\\\nena. (One of the most interesting of these phenomena is large-scale quantum computation\\\\nitself: can we create and systematically transform entangled states involving hundreds or\\\\nthousands of quantum variables?) A particularly powerful hypothesis from the point of\\\\nview of quantum computation is that of nonlinear quantum mechanics.\\\\n      The conventional picture of quantum mechanics is that it is linear in the sense that the\\\\nsuperposition principle is obeyed exactly. (Of course, quantum systems can still exhibit\\\\nnonlinear interactions between degrees of freedom while continuing to obey the superpo-\\\\nsition principle.) Experiment confirms that the superposition principle is indeed obeyed\\\\nto a high degree of accuracy. Nonetheless, a number of scientists including Weinberg have\\\\nproposed nonlinear versions of quantum mechanics in which the superposition principle\\\\nis violated. Many of these proposals exhibit pathologies such as violations of the second\\\\nlaw of thermodynamics or the capacity for superluminal communication. Despite such\\\\ntheoretical difficulties, it is still possible that quantum mechanics does indeed possess a\\\\nsmall nonlinearity, even if it currently seems unlikely. If a nonlinear operation such as\\\\nthat proposed by Weinberg can be incorporated in a quantum logic operation, then the\\\\nconsequences are striking: NP-complete problems can be solved easily in polynomial time\\\\n[17]. Indeed, NP-oracle problems and all problems in #P can be solved in polynomial time\\\\non such a nonlinear quantum computer.\\\\n      A general proof of this result is given in [17], however, a simple argument for why\\\\nthis is so can be seen as follows. Suppose that it is possible to perform a non-unitary\\\\noperation on a single qubit that has a positive Lyapunov exponent over some region: i.e.,\\\\nsomewhere on the unit sphere there exists a line of finite extent along which application of\\\\nthe operation causes nearby points to move apart exponentially at a rate eŒª‚àÜŒ∏ proportional\\\\n                                                           5', 'text_template': '{metadata_str}\\\\n\\\\n{content}'}, {'class_name': 'Document', 'doc_id': '5088dfa3-2556-47a0-bef7-d779e4baf772', 'embedding': None, 'end_char_idx': None, 'excluded_embed_metadata_keys': [], 'excluded_llm_metadata_keys': [], 'extra_info': {'file_name': 'Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices'}, 'metadata_seperator': '\\\\n', 'metadata_template': '{key}: {value}', 'mimetype': 'text/plain', 'relationships': {}, 'start_char_idx': None, 'text': 'to their original angular separation Œ¥Œ∏. Now consider a function f (x) from N bits to one\\\\nbit. We wish to determine whether or not there exists an x such that f (x) = 1, and if\\\\nso, how many such x‚Äôs there are. Using the nonlinear operation with positive Lyapunov\\\\nexponent, it is straightforward to construct a mapping leaves a point on the exponentially\\\\nexpanding line (call this point |0„Äâ) fixed if their are no solutions to the equation f (x) = 1,\\\\nand that maps the point to a nearby point cos(n/2N )|0„Äâ + sin(n/2N )|1„Äâ along the line\\\\nif there are exactly n solutions to the equation f (x) = 1. Repeated application of the\\\\nnonlinear map can be used to drive the points apart at an exponentional rate: eventually,\\\\nat a time determined by the number of qubits N , the number of solutions n, and the rate\\\\nof spreading Œª, the two points will become macroscopically distinguishable, allowing one\\\\nto determine whether or not there is a solution and if there is, how many solutions there\\\\nare. The map f need only be applied once, and the amount of time it takes to reveal the\\\\nnumber of solutions is proportional to N .\\\\n      The fact that nonlinear quantum mechanics allows the straightforward solution of\\\\nNP-complete and #P problems should probably be regarded as yet another strike against\\\\nnonlinear quantum mechanics. Whether or not quantum mechanics is linear is a question\\\\nto be resolved experimentally, however. In the unlikely event that quantum mechanics\\\\ndoes turn out to be nonlinear, all our problems may be solved.\\\\n      Finally, let us turn our attention to hypothetical quantum Theories of Everything,\\\\nsuch as string theory. Such a theory must clearly support quantum computation since it\\\\nsupports cavity quantum electrodynamics and nuclear magnetic resonance. The obvious\\\\nquestion to ask is then, does a Theory of Everything need to support anything more than\\\\nquantum computation? So far as experimental evidence is concerned the answer to this\\\\nquestion is apparently No: we have no evident reason to doubt that the universe is at\\\\nbottom anything more than a giant, parallel, quantum information processing machine,\\\\nand that the phenomena that we observe and attempt to characterize are simply outputs\\\\nof this machine‚Äôs ongoing computation. Of course, just how the universe is carrying out\\\\nthis computation is likely to remain a question of great interest for some time.\\\\n      To summarize: Computers are physical systems, and what they can do in practice and\\\\nin principle is circumscribed by the laws of physics.
